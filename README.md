# Logistic Regression Prediction Project

This project uses **machine learning** to build a predictive model using **Logistic Regression**.

## Dataset
- Replace this with your dataset link or description
- Features: Numerical or categorical depending on your data

## Model
- Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab (optional)

## Workflow
1. Load the dataset using Pandas.
2. Standardize features using `StandardScaler`.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets (`train_test_split`).
4. Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
5. Make predictions on the test set and evaluate performance.

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook or script.
2. Run all cells to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.
3. Check model performance metrics like accuracy.
